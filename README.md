RGB for Rage (RGB4R) is a simple mod for Grand Theft Auto V that adds support for Razer Chroma devices via Razer Synapse 3.

## Download

* [5mods](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/RGB4R)
* [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/justalemon/RGB4R/actions) (experimental versions)

## Installation

*Please note that you need to have Razer Synapse 3 with the Chroma Connect module for RGB4R to work.*
